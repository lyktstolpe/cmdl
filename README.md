# CMDL
### *Component Description Language*

CMDL is a very simple version of VHDL. CMDL generates a dataflow graph of binary values connected through one-way AND-, OR-, and NOT-gates. 

Composite components can be created and reused to make creating complex networks easier. See the example below for an example of a network making use of composite components.

A tree-sitter parser for CMDL is available [here.](https://github.com/lyktstolpe/tree-sitter-cmdl)

A detailed description of CMDLs features and how to use it might be coming.
